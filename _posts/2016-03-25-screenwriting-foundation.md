Screenwriting is the soul of filmmaking. It all begins with a screenplay a story that is written as a blueprint for a film. Have you ever walked out of a movie theater and said, "I think I could probably write something better than that"? In fact, a great movie idea can be difficult to come up with and a great screenplay can almost be even more difficult to write. Writing for the screen, especially the big screen, means you're composing something meant for a visual medium. And though it can be difficult to do well, a great screenplay has the power to be transformative for your viewers.
