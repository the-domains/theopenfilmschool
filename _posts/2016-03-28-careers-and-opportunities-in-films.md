  So where should one begin from? How should you be prepared? And, Can anyone be
  a filmmaker?



  Filmmaking is complex, expensive, and also time consuming. It can also be a big
  business. Potential filmmakers spend many years perfecting their profession
  while studying all aspects of this very popular art form.



  And to answer the last two questions, creativity, desire, motivation, focus,
  sensitivity, self discipline, patience and determination are few of the
  necessary attributes one must have to become involved in the art of film
  making. In addition, one must be compulsorily a unique storyteller .



  Attend a free session with The Open Film School and Fralk to understand the
  various careers and opportunities.
