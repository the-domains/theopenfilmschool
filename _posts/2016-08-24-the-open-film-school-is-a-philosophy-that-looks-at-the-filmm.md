  The Open Film school is a philosophy that looks at the art of filmmaking
  beyond just an introduction to the workings of a vocation. The Open Film
  School meditates on the art and the craft of this beautiful medium and
  encourages the aspiring filmmaker to develop her own worldview. It is an
  initiation into the magical world of cinema that paves the path for you to
  become its student and practitioner for life.
