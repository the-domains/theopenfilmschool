            <title><![CDATA[Screenwriting Foundation]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Screenwriting Foundation</h1><p>Screenwriting is the soul of filmmaking. It all begins with a screenplay a story that is written as a blueprint for a film. Have you ever walked out of a movie theater and said, “I think I could probably write something better than that”? In fact, a great movie idea can be difficult to come up with and a great screenplay can almost be even more difficult to write. Writing for the screen, especially the big screen, means you’re composing something meant for a visual medium. And though it can be difficult to do well, a great screenplay has the power to be transformative for your viewers. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f1292191-b6ef-4455-b26f-32c13de708e4.png"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Documentary Storytelling]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Documentary Storytelling</h1><p>Documentary filmmaking is a world of learning and seeking. Documentaries are the perfect place for young filmmakers to begin learning their craft. That’s because fiction film is about re-creating a version of reality, tuned to the story’s dramatic necessities. Documentaries, by contrast, require only that students choose the subject matter and capture what is already there.Watching documentaries is a wonderful way to expand your awareness of the world around you. It forces us to view a specific problem from an array of different perspectives.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/524b8170-86ac-4119-941d-97a225aea37b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
